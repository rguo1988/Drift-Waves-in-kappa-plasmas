The paper studies the suprathermal effects of electrons and ions on drift instability in inhomogeneous plasmas. 
The linear dispersion relation is expressed in a novel integral representation that involves the standard plasma dispersion functions defined in Maxwellian plasmas rather than the generalized plasma dispersion function modified by the Kappa distribution.
By using this new representation, we find that the suprathermalization of electrons gives rise to an instability threshold, which does not exist in Maxwellian plasmas.
Therefore, this work would improve our understanding of the drift instabilities in non-thermal plasmas.
